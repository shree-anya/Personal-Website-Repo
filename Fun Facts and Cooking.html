    <h2>Early Childhood</h2>
    <p>Growing up, I was a pretty talkative kid, I knew 4 languages, all of them were Indian languages. <br> Here's a not so fun fact: I forgot pretty much all of them and now predominantly just speak English</p>

    <h3>School</h3>
    <p>I was a very bright student ever since I started school. One of my first big accomplishments was in 5th grade.<br>
    My teacher said I got 100's so consistently on my Math tests, that she just made my test the answer key after a certain point.</p>

    <summary>Veggie Enchiladas</summary>
    <p>These tasty vegetable enchiladas are super easy to make with whatever leftover vegetables happen to be hanging out in your fridge. After many years of serving these enchiladas to veggie-lovers and veggie-skeptics alike, everyone loves these enchiladas no matter which veggies you toss in. They all get extra caramelized and yummy while roasting in the oven anyway, and then once they’re rolled up in tortillas and baked with zesty enchilada sauce and melty cheese. They’re too good to resist!</p>
